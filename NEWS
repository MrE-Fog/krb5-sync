                      User-Visible krb5-sync Changes

krb5-sync 1.0 (2007-08-13)

    Add a new option to krb5-sync-backend to tell process to filter out
    successful messages from krb5-sync and common errors that mean the
    account doesn't exist in Active Directory.  Also add support for the
    -h flag.

    Fix the logging output from Active Directory account status changes
    to not append the realm twice.

    Send krb5-sync logging to LOG_AUTH instead of LOG_AUTHPRIV to
    really match what kadmind does.

krb5-sync 0.7 (2007-08-07)

    Log a message to syslog from the plugin when password changes fail
    and we have to queue.  Otherwise, when the queuing is successful,
    we never log the original error.

    Work around the behavior of MIT Kerberos's Kerberos v4 compat
    libraries that left garbage in the instance field after parsing an
    unqualified principal with no instance.  Only of interest to users
    doing AFS password propagation.

    Log krb5-sync operations to LOG_AUTHPRIV (LOG_AUTH if that doesn't
    exist) so that they go to the same place as the kadmind logs do by
    default.

    Rename the provided patch to document that it only applies over top
    of the krb5-strength patches and provide a patch that applies to a
    stock MIT Kerberos 1.4.4 tree.

krb5-sync 0.6 (2007-07-13)

    Add support for propagating selected non-empty instances into the AFS
    and Active Directory environments rather than ignoring all principals
    with non-empty instances.

    Fix the Active Directory password change component to not overwrite
    the realm of the principal passed from kadmind so that logging of AFS
    password change attempts will contain the local realm instead of the
    AD realm.

    When enabling or disabling accounts in Active Directory, look them up
    by userPrincipalName instead of sAMAccountName.

    Correctly strip the realm for queuing even for principals containing
    escaped @ characters.

    Add Active Directory configuration instructions.  Thanks, Ross
    Wilper.

krb5-sync 0.5 (2007-03-22)

    Obtain new AFS tokens for each operation rather than reusing the
    existing token since ka_GetAdminToken isn't smart enough to realize
    that the old token has expired.

    Queue AD password changes rather than rejecting the change if the
    error message from the password change may indicate that the user
    doesn't exist in AD.

    Queue AD password changes if there is already an AD password change
    queued rather than rejecting the change.

    Include the username in status messages from the krb5-sync
    command-line utility.

krb5-sync 0.4 (2007-01-23)

    The krb5-sync command-line utility now supports taking its actions
    from a file instead of the command-line.  Those queue files can also
    specify changing the password only in Active Directory or only in an
    AFS kaserver.

    The plugin will now queue account status changes and AFS password
    changes if making the change fails or if a change of that type is
    already queued for that account.

    Add a new Perl script, krb5-sync-backend, which supports listing and
    processing the queue and queuing particular changes.

krb5-sync 0.3 (2007-01-05)

    First publicly released version.  Includes a patch for MIT Kerberos
    1.4.4, a plugin that can synchronize passwords to one Active Directory
    realm and/or one AFS kaserver realm and enabled flag changes to one
    Active Directory realm, and command-line utilities to perform the same
    actions as the plugin.
