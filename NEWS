                      User-Visible krb5-sync Changes

krb5-sync 0.4 (2007-01-23)

    The krb5-sync command-line utility now supports taking its actions
    from a file instead of the command-line.  Those queue files can also
    specify changing the password only in Active Directory or only in an
    AFS kaserver.

    The plugin will now queue account status changes and AFS password
    changes if making the change fails or if a change of that type is
    already queued for that account.

    Add a new Perl script, krb5-sync-backend, which supports listing and
    processing the queue and queuing particular changes.

krb5-sync 0.3 (2007-01-05)

    First publicly released version.  Includes a patch for MIT Kerberos
    1.4.4, a plugin that can synchronize passwords to one Active Directory
    realm and/or one AFS kaserver realm and enabled flag changes to one
    Active Directory realm, and command-line utilities to perform the same
    actions as the plugin.
