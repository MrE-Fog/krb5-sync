krb5-sync 0.4 (unreleased)

    The krb5-sync command-line utility now supports taking its actions
    from a file instead of the command-line.  Those queue files can also
    specify changing the password only in Active Directory or only in an
    AFS kaserver.

krb5-sync 0.3 (2007-01-05)

    First publicly released version.  Includes a patch for MIT Kerberos
    1.4.4, a plugin that can synchronize passwords to one Active Directory
    realm and/or one AFS kaserver realm and enabled flag changes to one
    Active Directory realm, and command-line utilities to perform the same
    actions as the plugin.
