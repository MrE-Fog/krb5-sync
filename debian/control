Description: Heimdal KDC plugin for password synchronization
 This plugin synchronizes passwords changed via kadmind to a foreign realm
 via the Kerberos v5 password change protocol.  It can also propagate
 changes to DISALLOW_ALL_TIX flag to Windows AD using LDAP.  It is built
 against Heimdal Kerberos but requires a patched version of Heimdal's
 libkadm5srv library to be called by kadmin, kadmind, and kpasswdd.
