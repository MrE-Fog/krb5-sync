krb5-passwd-sync for Debian
---------------------------

This plugin requires a patched kadmind that loads plugins for password
propagation.  This code will hopefully be in a future official release
of MIT Kerberos.  It also requires krb5.conf additions as described in
README.gz and the addition of:

    pwupdate_plugin = /usr/lib/kadmind/passwd_update.so

to the kdc.conf configuration section for the local realm.
