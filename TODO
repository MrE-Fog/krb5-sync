                           krb5-sync To-Do List

 * The AFS code currently builds unconditionally, so if the AFS libraries
   weren't found at configure time, the build just fails.  It should
   instead all be protected by #ifdef and not built if the AFS libraries
   aren't found, since most people aren't going to care about AFS kaserver
   synchronization.

 * The base DN for finding users in Active Directory probably has to be
   configurable.  I think that ou=Accounts may be a local peculiarity, and
   even if not, I can see people putting accounts in different trees.

 * After remctl has been modified to allow passing of some parameters on
   standard input, change krb5-sync-backend to accept the password on
   standard input to avoid exposing it on the command line.

 * krb5-sync-backend should get the path to Perl from configure.
