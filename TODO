                           krb5-sync To-Do List

 * The AFS code currently builds unconditionally, so if the AFS libraries
   weren't found at configure time, the build just fails.  It should
   instead all be protected by #ifdef and not built if the AFS libraries
   aren't found, since most people aren't going to care about AFS kaserver
   synchronization.

 * Support queuing of changes and replaying the queue.  This will require
   modifying krb5-sync to support reading actions from a queue file and
   then modifications to the AFS kaserver update code and the Active
   Directory status code to queue if the update fails for some reason.
   I'll probably also add a utility to show the current queue, remove
   specific queued actions, queue new actions, or run all queued actions.

 * The base DN for finding users in Active Directory probably has to be
   configurable.  I think that ou=Accounts may be a local peculiarity, and
   even if not, I can see people putting accounts in different trees.
