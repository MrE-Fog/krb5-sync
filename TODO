                           krb5-sync To-Do List

 * Fix the krb5-sync utility so that it doesn't unconditionally attempt
   to sync passwords to Active Directory even when no Active Directory
   configuration is present.

 * The base DN for finding users in Active Directory probably has to be
   configurable.

 * After remctl has been modified to allow passing of some parameters on
   standard input, change krb5-sync-backend to accept the password on
   standard input to avoid exposing it on the command line.

 * krb5-sync-backend should get the path to Perl and krb5-sync from
   configure.

 * Currently, the queue path is hard-coded in krb5-sync-backend even
   though for the plugin it's configurable in krb5.conf.
   krb5-sync-backend needs to be able to read the krb5.conf value somehow.

 * A test suite would be nice, probably drawing on the code in the wallet
   for testing Kerberos operations and keys.
